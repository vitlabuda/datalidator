# 5. Lists and Dictionaries

Datalidator has built-in support for the following two (probably the most common) collections: **lists** and 
**dictionaries**.


## Lists
To parse lists, use [`ListBlueprint`](../datalidator/blueprints/impl/ListBlueprint.py). The blueprint takes an input 
value, converts it to a `list` object, runs its items through the blueprint passed to the mandatory `item_blueprint` 
initializer argument, and returns a resulting `list` object (which contains items returned by `item_blueprint`).

The following example shows how to parse a list of integers:
```python
from datalidator.blueprints.impl.ListBlueprint import ListBlueprint
from datalidator.blueprints.impl.IntegerBlueprint import IntegerBlueprint

blueprint = ListBlueprint(
    item_blueprint=IntegerBlueprint()
)

blueprint.use([2, 1, 3])  # == [2, 1, 3]
blueprint.use([2.9, "1", "  3\r\n"])  # == [2, 1, 3]
blueprint.use((2, 1, 3))  # == [2, 1, 3]
blueprint.use((2.9, "1", "  3\r\n"))  # == [2, 1, 3]

blueprint.use([2, None, 3])  # raises InputDataTypeNotInAllowlistExc (= a subclass of DatalidatorExc)
blueprint.use((2, None, 3))  # raises InputDataTypeNotInAllowlistExc (= a subclass of DatalidatorExc)
blueprint.use(1)  # raises InputDataNotConvertibleExc (= a subclass of DatalidatorExc)
blueprint.use(None)  # raises InputDataNotConvertibleExc (= a subclass of DatalidatorExc)
```


## Dictionaries
To parse dictionaries, use [`DictionaryBlueprint`](../datalidator/blueprints/impl/DictionaryBlueprint.py). The blueprint 
takes an input value, converts it to a `dict` object, runs its keys and values through the blueprints passed to the 
mandatory `key_blueprint` and `value_blueprint` initializer arguments, and returns a resulting `dict` object (which 
contains keys returned by `key_blueprint` and values returned by `value_blueprint`).

The following example shows how to parse a `str -> int` dictionary:
```python
from datalidator.blueprints.impl.DictionaryBlueprint import DictionaryBlueprint
from datalidator.blueprints.impl.StringBlueprint import StringBlueprint
from datalidator.blueprints.impl.IntegerBlueprint import IntegerBlueprint

blueprint = DictionaryBlueprint(
    key_blueprint=StringBlueprint(),
    value_blueprint=IntegerBlueprint()
)

blueprint.use({"hello": 1, "True": -2, "5": 3})  # == {"hello": 1, "True": -2, "5": 3}
blueprint.use({"hello": 1, "True": "  -2\r\n", "5": 3.9})  # == {"hello": 1, "True": -2, "5": 3}
blueprint.use({"hello": 1, True: -2, 5: 3})  # == {"hello": 1, "True": -2, "5": 3}
blueprint.use({"hello": 1, True: "  -2\r\n", 5: 3.9})  # == {"hello": 1, "True": -2, "5": 3}
blueprint.use([["hello", 1], ["True", -2], ["5", 3]])  # == {"hello": 1, "True": -2, "5": 3}
blueprint.use([["hello", 1], [True, "  -2\r\n"], [5, 3.9]])  # == {"hello": 1, "True": -2, "5": 3}

blueprint.use({"hello": 1, "True": None, "5": 3})  # raises InputDataTypeNotInAllowlistExc (= a subclass of DatalidatorExc)
blueprint.use({"hello": 1, tuple(): -2, "5": 3})  # raises InputDataTypeNotInAllowlistExc (= a subclass of DatalidatorExc)
blueprint.use(1)  # raises InputDataNotConvertibleExc (= a subclass of DatalidatorExc)
blueprint.use(None)  # raises InputDataNotConvertibleExc (= a subclass of DatalidatorExc)
```

NOTE: `DictionaryBlueprint` does not have the ability to check whether certain keys are present in the dictionary and
to pass values of different keys to different blueprints which is something you are very likely to want when parsing
structured data (e.g. config files, API outputs, etc.). However, there are two built-in blueprints available 
which have the aforementioned features: 
[`PredefinedDictionaryBlueprint`](../datalidator/blueprints/impl/PredefinedDictionaryBlueprint.py) and 
[`ObjectBlueprint`](../datalidator/blueprints/impl/ObjectBlueprint.py). These blueprints are described in the 
[next chapter](006_Object-Blueprint.md) of this tutorial.
