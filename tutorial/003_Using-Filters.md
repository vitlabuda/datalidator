# 3. Using Filters

As already mentioned before, the purpose of filters is to modify data already parsed by a blueprint (i.e. NOT the 
untrusted input data!) in some way without changing their data type.

This library already comes with a considerable number of filter implementations, for example:
- [DatetimeAddTimezoneFilter](../datalidator/filters/impl/DatetimeAddTimezoneFilter.py)
- [DatetimeChangeTimezoneFilter](../datalidator/filters/impl/DatetimeChangeTimezoneFilter.py)
- [ListDeduplicateItemsFilter](../datalidator/filters/impl/ListDeduplicateItemsFilter.py)
- [ListSortFilter](../datalidator/filters/impl/ListSortFilter.py)
- [NumberMaximumClampFilter](../datalidator/filters/impl/NumberMaximumClampFilter.py)
- [NumberMinimumClampFilter](../datalidator/filters/impl/NumberMinimumClampFilter.py)
- [NumberRoundFilter](../datalidator/filters/impl/NumberRoundFilter.py)
- [ReplacementMapFilter](../datalidator/filters/impl/ReplacementMapFilter.py)
- [StringLowercaseFilter](../datalidator/filters/impl/StringLowercaseFilter.py)
- [StringRegexReplaceFilter](../datalidator/filters/impl/StringRegexReplaceFilter.py)
- [StringReplaceFilter](../datalidator/filters/impl/StringReplaceFilter.py)
- [StringStripFilter](../datalidator/filters/impl/StringStripFilter.py)
- [StringUppercaseFilter](../datalidator/filters/impl/StringUppercaseFilter.py)
- [UnixFilesystemPathAddTrailingSlashFilter](../datalidator/filters/impl/UnixFilesystemPathAddTrailingSlashFilter.py)
- [UnixFilesystemPathStripTrailingSlashesFilter](../datalidator/filters/impl/UnixFilesystemPathStripTrailingSlashesFilter.py)

See the [datalidator/filters/impl](../datalidator/filters/impl) directory or the 
[class hierarchy document](Appendix-001_Class-Hierarchy.md) to see all the filter implementations that come with this 
library.

Filters should not be used directly; instead, they should be passed into a blueprint's `__init__()` method, as shown in 
the examples below. The blueprint will use the filters in the order in which they were passed into its initializer 
automatically after the untrusted input data are parsed.


### Example 1: Basic use
The following example shows how strings parsed using `StringBlueprint` have their leading and trailing whitespace 
characters stripped using `StringStripFilter`, and then are lowercased using `StringLowercaseFilter`:
```python
from datalidator.blueprints.impl.StringBlueprint import StringBlueprint
from datalidator.filters.impl.StringStripFilter import StringStripFilter
from datalidator.filters.impl.StringLowercaseFilter import StringLowercaseFilter

blueprint = StringBlueprint(filters=[
    StringStripFilter(),  # Strips leading and trailing whitespace characters (by default)
    StringLowercaseFilter()  # Lowercases the string
])

blueprint.use("hello")  # == 'hello'
blueprint.use("Hello")  # == 'hello'
blueprint.use("HELLO")  # == 'hello'
blueprint.use("   hello\r\n")  # == 'hello'
blueprint.use("   Hello\r\n")  # == 'hello'
blueprint.use("   HELLO\r\n")  # == 'hello'
```


### Example 2: Generic filters
While most filters are likely to be bound to a specific data type (such as in the above example), filters that can be
used on more or even all data types can exist as well. The following example shows the only such filter bundled with 
this library, `ReplacementMapFilter`, which can be used to replace certain output values with another:
```python
from datalidator.blueprints.impl.StringBlueprint import StringBlueprint
from datalidator.filters.impl.ReplacementMapFilter import ReplacementMapFilter

blueprint = StringBlueprint(filters=[
    ReplacementMapFilter(replacement_map=[
        ("hello", "hi"),
        ("goodbye", "bye")
    ])
])

blueprint.use("hello")  # == 'hi'
blueprint.use("Hello")  # == 'Hello'
blueprint.use("hello!")  # == 'hello!'
blueprint.use("hi")  # == 'hi'

blueprint.use("goodbye")  # == 'bye'
blueprint.use("Goodbye")  # == 'Goodbye'
blueprint.use("goodbye!")  # == 'goodbye!'
blueprint.use("bye")  # == 'bye'

blueprint.use("something else")  # == 'something else'
blueprint.use("")  # == ''
```
