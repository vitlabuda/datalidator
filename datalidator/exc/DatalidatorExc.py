    A superclass of all exceptions raised by Datalidator.

    One should catch exceptions that inherit from this class in the vast majority of cases because they can commonly
     occur even when one is using the library in a completely correct way - for example when invalid input data are
     passed to a blueprint's use() method (which is something that will happen if this library is used to handle
     untrusted user input in any way).
