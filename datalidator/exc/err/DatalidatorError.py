    A superclass of all errors raised by Datalidator.
    Never raised directly - only its subclasses are raised.

    One should not catch errors that inherit from this class in most cases because they can occur only when
     the library is used incorrectly, for example when an invalid argument is passed to a blueprint's initializer, and
     not for example as a result of invalid input data passed to a blueprint's use() method (this is what
     DatalidatorExc is here for). Therefore, these errors are not mentioned in methods' docstrings.
