    The interface of all blueprints.

    The purpose of blueprints is to safely and reliably parse untrusted input data to a specific blueprint's output
     data type and raise an appropriate exception if it is not possible (i.e. blueprints must be able to react to input
     data of any type and value without getting into an unexpected state under regular conditions). If applicable,
     blueprints should also be capable of running the parsed data through filters and validators.

    Blueprints MUST be thread-safe and SHOULD be immutable (i.e. it should not be possible to *knowingly* change the
     internal state of a blueprint instance after its initialization).

        Converts untrusted (!) 'input_data' into output data of generic type 'VT' in an appropriate way, and if
         applicable, runs the output data through a user-provided sequence of filters and validators.

        If possible, the output should not be the same instance as input and the output's type should not be a subclass
         of the desired output type (to prevent subclasses which are not respecting Liskov substitution principle
         from being returned and then breaking the program which is using the blueprint).

        Since 'input_data' are untrusted and can be of any data type, blueprints should ensure that they can properly
         handle the data's unexpected behaviour. This includes being able to catch and handle unexpected exceptions
         ('DefaultBlueprintImplBase' already does this, but it should be considered only a last resort solution - if
         you expect that something may go wrong, you should handle it properly yourselves!).
