        Converts untrusted (!) 'input_data' into output data of generic type 'VT' in an appropriate way, and if
         applicable, runs the output data through a user-provided sequence of filters and validators.

        If possible, the output should not be the same instance as input and the output's type should not be a subclass
         of the desired output type (to prevent subclasses which are not respecting Liskov substitution principle
         from being returned and then breaking the program which is using the blueprint).

        Since 'input_data' are untrusted and can be of any data type, blueprints should ensure that they can properly
         handle the data's unexpected behaviour. This includes being able to catch and handle unexpected exceptions.
         This method runs in a context where all exceptions other than 'DatalidatorExc' and its subclasses are caught
         and handled (by raising 'UnexpectedExceptionRaisedExc', a subclass of 'DatalidatorExc'). However, this
         behaviour should be considered only a last resort solution of the problem when everything else fails - if you
         expect that something may go wrong, you should handle it properly yourselves!
